                            The first step to learning programming is to identify the programming language youâ€™d want to learn.

                            </Card.Body>

                            <Card.Body>
                            <Card.Title>Basic level</Card.Title>
                            <Card.Text>
                            This step involves deciding which platform you are most interested in developing an application for. I have enlisted below the programming languages that I suggest you go for when choosing one:
                            </Card.Text>
                            </Card.Body>
                        </div>
                        </Col>
                        <Col>
                        <div className="carD">
                            <Card.Body>
                            <Card.Title>Enter mediate level </Card.Title>
                            <Card.Text>
                            Because of this I think that it is well worth taking the time to learn some programming basics before you even start learning the ins and outs of a programming language and writing your first line of code.

                        </div>
